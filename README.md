# StackView Experiments
This project allows to modify stackview properties and view effect live

## Xcode Version: 11.4


This app gives you flexibility to change stackview axis, distribution, alignment and spacing at run time along with UIlabel texts. I have added 2 labels in stackview so it gives flexibility to add texts for both labels.
